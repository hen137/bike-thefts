## Quick Reference

### Architecture Layers

| Layer          | Role                           | Key Concept                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| React Elements | Lightweight descriptions of UI | Immutable objects created by JSX/createElement   |
| Components     | Functions that return elements | Pure functions of props and state                |
| Fiber Tree     | Internal work-in-progress tree | Enables incremental rendering and prioritization |
| Reconciler     | Diffing algorithm              | Compares previous and next element trees         |
| Renderer       | Platform-specific output       | `react-dom` for web, `react-native` for mobile   |

### Core Principles

| Principle                    | Rule                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unidirectional Data Flow     | Data ALWAYS flows from parent to child via props                                |
| Declarative UI               | ALWAYS describe what the UI should look like, NEVER imperatively mutate the DOM |
| Composition over Inheritance | ALWAYS compose components, NEVER use class inheritance for component reuse      |
| Pure Rendering               | The render phase MUST be a pure function of props and state                     |
| Immutable Updates            | NEVER mutate state or props directly; ALWAYS create new references              |

### React Element vs Component

| Concept       | What It Is                                                | Example                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React Element | Immutable plain object describing a DOM node or component | `{ type: 'div', props: { children: 'Hello' } }`                  |
| Component     | Function that accepts props and returns React elements    | `function Greeting({ name }: Props) { return <h1>{name}</h1>; }` |
| Fiber         | Internal mutable work unit tracking a component instance  | Not directly accessible; managed by React internals              |

## Critical Warnings

**NEVER** mutate state or props during rendering -- rendering MUST be a pure calculation. Mutations cause inconsistent UI and break concurrent features.

**NEVER** rely on render timing or count -- React MAY call your component multiple times, skip renders, or pause and resume rendering. StrictMode double-invokes components in development.

**NEVER** perform side effects in the render phase (network requests, subscriptions, DOM mutations) -- ALWAYS use `useEffect` or event handlers for side effects.

**NEVER** use inheritance to share behavior between components -- ALWAYS use composition (children, render props, or custom hooks).

**NEVER** call `root.render()` where `hydrateRoot()` is needed -- for server-rendered HTML, ALWAYS use `hydrateRoot` to preserve server markup and attach event handlers.

**NEVER** assume synchronous DOM updates after `root.render()` -- rendering is asynchronous. Use `flushSync()` ONLY when synchronous behavior is explicitly required.

---

## Rendering Model

### JSX Compilation

JSX is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()` calls:

```tsx
// JSX (what you write)
<Greeting name="Taylor" />;

// Compiled output (what React sees)
createElement(Greeting, { name: "Taylor" });
```

The returned React element is an immutable object:

```tsx
{
  type: Greeting,       // Component function or string tag
  props: { name: 'Taylor' },
  key: null,
  ref: null
}
```

**ALWAYS** use capital letters for component names in JSX -- lowercase names resolve to HTML tags, not components.

### Three-Phase Rendering Cycle

React updates the screen in three sequential steps:

| Phase      | What Happens                                                  | Interruptible?        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1. Trigger | Initial `root.render()` call or a state update via `setState` | N/A                   |
| 2. Render  | React calls component functions and diffs the element tree    | Yes (concurrent mode) |
| 3. Commit  | React applies minimal DOM mutations to match the new tree     | No (synchronous)      |

After the commit phase, the **browser paints** the updated screen.

### Render Phase (Pure)

- React calls your component function to produce a new element tree
- Compares the new tree with the previous tree (reconciliation)
- In concurrent mode (React 18+), this phase is **interruptible** -- React can pause, resume, or discard work
- MUST be pure: no side effects, no DOM mutations, no subscriptions

### Commit Phase (Synchronous)

- React applies the **minimal set** of DOM changes identified during reconciliation
- Runs `useLayoutEffect` cleanup and setup synchronously
- The browser paints the screen
- Runs `useEffect` cleanup and setup asynchronously after paint

### Reconciliation Algorithm

React's diffing strategy uses two key heuristics:

1. **Different element types** produce different trees -- React tears down the old subtree and builds a new one
2. **Keys** identify which children remain stable across re-renders -- ALWAYS provide stable keys for list items

```tsx
// React preserves <input> because the element type and position match
<div>
  <input value={text} /> {/* Same position, same type = preserved */}
</div>
```

---

## Fiber Architecture (React 16+)

The Fiber reconciler replaced the legacy stack reconciler to enable:

| Capability            | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incremental rendering | Split rendering work into chunks across multiple frames |
| Priority scheduling   | Urgent updates (user input) preempt lower-priority work |
| Pause and resume      | Interrupt in-progress work without losing progress      |
| Concurrent rendering  | Prepare multiple UI versions simultaneously (React 18+) |

Each fiber node represents a component instance and contains:

- `type` -- the component function or host element tag
- `stateNode` -- the DOM node (for host elements) or component instance
- `child`, `sibling`, `return` -- tree navigation pointers
- `memoizedState` -- the linked list of hooks for this component
- `pendingProps`, `memoizedProps` -- current and previous props
- `lanes` -- priority bits for scheduling (React 18+)

**NEVER** access fiber internals directly -- they are private implementation details that change between React versions.

## Component Lifecycle

### Function Component Lifecycle

```
Mount:      Component called -> Elements created -> DOM inserted -> Effects run
Update:     State/props change -> Component re-called -> Reconciliation -> DOM patched -> Effects re-run
Unmount:    Effect cleanups run -> DOM removed
```

| Phase   | What Runs                                                                   | When                                |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Mount   | Component function, then `useEffect` callbacks                              | First render, after DOM insertion   |
| Update  | Component function, then `useEffect` cleanups + callbacks (if deps changed) | On state or props change            |
| Unmount | `useEffect` cleanup functions                                               | When component is removed from tree |

### Entry Point: createRoot

```tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import App from "./App";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!, {
  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {
    console.error("Caught:", error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  },
  onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {
    console.error("Uncaught:", error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }
});

root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

**ALWAYS** wrap the root in `<StrictMode>` during development to detect impure renders, missing effect cleanups, and deprecated APIs.

---

## Component Tree Model

### Render Tree

The render tree represents the component hierarchy for a single render pass:

- **Nodes** are React components (not HTML elements)
- **Root node** is the top-level component passed to `root.render()`
- **Top-level components** near the root affect performance of all descendants
- **Leaf components** at the bottom are frequently re-rendered

The tree changes dynamically with conditional rendering -- different state produces different subtrees.

### Unidirectional Data Flow

```
State (parent) --> Props (child) --> Props (grandchild)
     ^                                      |
     |                                      |
     +-------- Callbacks (events) <---------+
```

Data flows DOWN through props. Communication UP happens through callback functions passed as props. NEVER pass data upward by mutating parent state from a child without using a callback.

---

## StrictMode Behavior (Development Only)

| Check                  | Method                               | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Impure rendering       | Double-invokes component functions   | Catches render-phase mutations    |
| Missing effect cleanup | Runs setup -> cleanup -> setup cycle | Catches missing cleanup functions |
| Missing ref cleanup    | Double ref callback cycle            | Catches ref-related memory leaks  |
| Deprecated APIs        | Static warnings                      | Flags legacy lifecycle methods    |

StrictMode checks run ONLY in development. They have zero impact on production builds.

| `useActionState`     | Not available                     | Manages async action state                               |
| `useOptimistic`      | Not available                     | Optimistic UI updates                                    |
| Metadata tags        | Require `react-helmet` or similar | Native `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>` hoisting            |
| Error callbacks      | `onRecoverableError` only         | `onCaughtError`, `onUncaughtError`, `onRecoverableError` |
