## Quick Reference

### Debugging Tools Overview

| Tool                        | Purpose                                  | When to Use                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| React DevTools (Components) | Inspect props, state, hooks, context     | Component data inspection       |
| React DevTools (Profiler)   | Render timing, flamegraph, ranked chart  | Performance investigation       |
| Browser DevTools (Console)  | Read React warnings and error messages   | Error diagnosis                 |
| Browser DevTools (Sources)  | Set breakpoints, step through code       | Logic debugging                 |
| `<StrictMode>`              | Surface impure renders, unsafe effects   | Development-time bug prevention |
| `why-did-you-render`        | Log unnecessary re-renders with reasons  | Re-render optimization          |
| Source maps                 | Map production errors to original source | Production debugging            |

### Critical Warnings

**NEVER** remove `<StrictMode>` to "fix" double-rendering issues -- the double invocation is intentional. It exposes impure components and side effects. ALWAYS fix the underlying impurity instead.

**NEVER** ignore React console warnings -- they indicate real bugs or future breaking changes. ALWAYS resolve every warning before shipping.

**NEVER** debug production builds without source maps -- error messages are stripped and minified in production. ALWAYS generate source maps for staging/debugging environments.

**ALWAYS** check the component stack trace when diagnosing errors -- React prints the component tree path that led to the error, which pinpoints the source.

**ALWAYS** use the Profiler tab (not just the Components tab) when investigating performance -- visual inspection of the component tree does NOT reveal render timing.

---

## Strict Mode

`<StrictMode>` is a development-only tool that helps find bugs by intentionally double-invoking certain functions.

### What Strict Mode Double-Invokes

| Function Type               | Double-Invoked?             | Why                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Component function body     | Yes                         | Detects impure rendering (side effects during render) |
| `useState` initializer      | Yes                         | Detects impure initialization                         |
| `useReducer` reducer        | Yes                         | Detects impure reducers                               |
| `useReducer` initializer    | Yes                         | Detects impure initialization                         |
| `useMemo` callback          | Yes                         | Detects impure memoization                            |
| `useEffect` setup + cleanup | Yes (mount/unmount/remount) | Detects missing cleanup logic                         |
| `useRef` — NO               | No                          | Refs are not double-invoked                           |

### Strict Mode Behavior

```tsx
// StrictMode wraps your app (or a subtree)
import { StrictMode } from "react";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

In development, React will:

1. Render component -> call cleanup -> re-render component (simulating unmount/remount)
2. Call state initializers twice and discard the first result
3. Call reducers twice and discard the first result

### Common Strict Mode Mistakes

```tsx
// BAD: Side effect in render — Strict Mode exposes this by double-calling
function Counter(): JSX.Element {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`; // NEVER do this in render
  return <div>{count}</div>;
}

// GOOD: Side effect in useEffect
function Counter(): JSX.Element {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);
  return <div>{count}</div>;
}
```

```tsx
// BAD: Effect without cleanup — Strict Mode exposes the leak
function ChatRoom({ roomId }: { roomId: string }): JSX.Element {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.connect();
    // Missing cleanup! StrictMode will connect TWICE
  }, [roomId]);
  return <div>Chat: {roomId}</div>;
}

// GOOD: Effect with proper cleanup
function ChatRoom({ roomId }: { roomId: string }): JSX.Element {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect(); // ALWAYS clean up
  }, [roomId]);
  return <div>Chat: {roomId}</div>;
}
```

## Console Warnings Diagnostic Table

| Warning Message                                                               | Cause                                                                   | Fix                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop"                        | Array items rendered without `key` or with duplicate/index keys         | ALWAYS provide a stable, unique `key` from data (e.g., `id`). NEVER use array index as key when items reorder.                                 |
| "Cannot update a component (`X`) while rendering a different component (`Y`)" | Calling `setState` of component X inside the render body of component Y | Move the state update into a `useEffect` or event handler. NEVER call setState during render of another component.                             |
| "Maximum update depth exceeded"                                               | Infinite re-render loop from setState in useEffect without proper deps  | Check `useEffect` dependencies — ensure the effect does not unconditionally trigger its own dependency. Add missing deps or restructure logic. |
| "Objects are not valid as a React child"                                      | Passing an object/array directly as JSX child text                      | Convert to string with `JSON.stringify()`, or map array to elements. NEVER render raw objects.                                                 |
| "Function components cannot be given refs"                                    | Passing `ref` to a function component without `forwardRef`              | Wrap component with `forwardRef` (React 18) or accept `ref` as a prop (React 19).                                                              |
| "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component"                | setState called after component unmounted (React 17 and earlier)        | This warning was REMOVED in React 18. If seen in React 18+, you have a version mismatch. In React 17, use cleanup to cancel async operations.  |
| "Invalid hook call"                                                           | Hook called outside component/hook, or mismatched React versions        | Verify hooks are at top level of component/hook. Check for duplicate React installations with `npm ls react`.                                  |
| "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"                         | Conditional hook call — hook count changed between renders              | NEVER call hooks inside conditions, loops, or early returns. ALWAYS call all hooks in the same order.                                          |

## React DevTools

### Components Tab

The Components tab shows the live component tree with inspectable data:

| Feature                | What It Shows                                   | How to Use                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Component tree         | Hierarchy of mounted components                 | Click to select, use search to filter    |
| Props panel            | Current props of selected component             | Expand objects, edit values live         |
| Hooks panel            | Current hook values (state, ref, memo, context) | Shows hook name and current value        |
| Source link            | "< >" icon links to component source            | Click to open in Sources tab             |
| Rendered by            | Which parent rendered this component            | Shows in sidebar when component selected |
| Owner stack (React 19) | Full owner component chain                      | Shows which component created this one   |

### Profiler Tab

| Feature                | Purpose                              | Interpretation                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flamegraph             | Visualize render time per component  | Wide bars = slow renders. Grey bars = did not render.        |
| Ranked chart           | Components sorted by render duration | Focus optimization on top-ranked components                  |
| "Why did this render?" | Shows render trigger reason          | Enable via gear icon -> "Record why each component rendered" |
| Commit selector        | Browse individual render commits     | Each commit = one React render batch                         |
| Render duration        | Time in ms for each component        | Compare before/after optimization                            |

### Profiler Workflow

1. Open React DevTools -> Profiler tab
2. Click gear icon -> enable "Record why each component rendered while profiling"
3. Click Record (blue circle)
4. Perform the interaction you want to measure
5. Click Stop
6. Analyze: flamegraph for overview, ranked chart for worst offenders
7. Check "Why did this render?" for each slow component

## Component Stack Traces

When React throws an error, it prints a **component stack trace** showing the component hierarchy:

```
Error: Something went wrong
    at UserProfile (UserProfile.tsx:15)
    at div
    at Dashboard (Dashboard.tsx:8)
    at ErrorBoundary (ErrorBoundary.tsx:5)
    at App (App.tsx:12)
```

### Reading Component Stacks

- Read **top to bottom**: the topmost component is where the error occurred
- Native HTML elements (e.g., `at div`) appear in the stack
- File names and line numbers point to the component definition
- ALWAYS look at the first custom component in the stack -- that is the error source

### React 19 Improvements

React 19 introduces **owner stacks** via `captureOwnerStack()`:

```tsx
import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";

// In an error boundary or error handler:
function handleError(error: Error): void {
  const ownerStack = captureOwnerStack();
  console.error("Error:", error.message);
  console.error("Owner stack:", ownerStack);
  // Owner stack shows WHICH component created the erroring component
  // (not just the render tree, but the ownership/creation chain)
}
```

## Common Error Messages Diagnostic Table

| Error Message                                                  | Cause                                                             | Fix                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Minified React error #XXX`                                    | Production build with stripped error messages                     | Look up the error code at `https://react.dev/errors/XXX` or debug with development build                                      |
| `Too many re-renders`                                          | Component unconditionally calls setState during render            | NEVER call `setState` directly in component body. Use `useEffect` or event handlers.                                          |
| `Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match`       | Server HTML differs from client render                            | Ensure server and client render identical output. Check for `typeof window` guards, `Date.now()`, or random values in render. |
| `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')`          | Multiple React copies or hook called outside component            | Run `npm ls react` to check for duplicates. Ensure hooks are called inside components only.                                   |
| `Uncaught Invariant Violation`                                 | Internal React assertion failed                                   | Usually indicates a bug in your code violating React rules. Check the message details.                                        |
| `Element type is invalid: expected a string or class/function` | Component is `undefined` at render time                           | Check import statement — likely a typo, default vs named export mismatch, or circular dependency.                             |
| `Cannot update during an existing state transition`            | `setState` called inside `render()` or `getDerivedStateFromProps` | Move state update to `useEffect` or `componentDidMount`/`componentDidUpdate`.                                                 |

## Development vs Production Differences

| Aspect           | Development                                      | Production                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error messages   | Full descriptive messages with component stacks  | Minified error codes (e.g., `Minified React error #310`) |
| Strict Mode      | Active (double-invokes renders, effects)         | Completely stripped — no double invocations              |
| Console warnings | All warnings displayed                           | Most warnings suppressed                                 |
| Performance      | Slower due to extra checks, Strict Mode overhead | Optimized, no dev-only checks                            |
| Profiling        | DevTools Profiler works out of the box           | Requires profiling build: `react-dom/profiling`          |
| Source maps      | Available by default (dev server)                | Must be explicitly generated and deployed                |
| PropTypes        | Validated at runtime (if used)                   | Stripped entirely                                        |

### Debugging Production Errors

1. **Look up minified error codes**: Visit `https://react.dev/errors/{code}` for the full message
2. **Generate source maps**: Configure your bundler to produce `.map` files for staging
3. **Use profiling build** for production performance analysis:

```tsx
// webpack.config.ts — alias for profiling build
resolve: {
  alias: {
    "react-dom$": "react-dom/profiling",
    "scheduler/tracing": "scheduler/tracing-profiling",
  },
}
```

4. **Error monitoring**: Use services that can decode source maps server-side (Sentry, Bugsnag)

## React 19 Debugging Improvements

| Feature                     | React 18                              | React 19                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydration mismatch errors   | Generic "did not match" message       | Detailed diff showing exact HTML differences                                        |
| Error reporting             | Component stack only                  | Owner stacks via `captureOwnerStack()`                                              |
| Third-party script handling | Hydration errors on injected elements | Automatically skips unexpected `<script>`, `<style>`, `<link>` in `<head>`/`<body>` |
| ref on function components  | Requires `forwardRef` wrapper         | `ref` is a regular prop — no wrapper needed                                         |
| useEffect cleanup timing    | Synchronous during unmount            | Consistent async cleanup with transition support                                    |

## Debugging Tools Setup

### React DevTools Extension

ALWAYS install the React DevTools browser extension for Chrome or Firefox. It adds the Components and Profiler tabs to browser DevTools.

- Chrome: Search "React Developer Tools" in Chrome Web Store
- Firefox: Search "React Developer Tools" in Firefox Add-ons
- Standalone (for React Native/iframe): `npx react-devtools`

### why-did-you-render Library

For granular re-render tracking beyond DevTools Profiler:

```tsx
// wdyr.ts — MUST be imported BEFORE React
import React from "react";

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  const whyDidYouRender = await import("@welldone-software/why-did-you-render");
  whyDidYouRender.default(React, {
    trackAllPureComponents: true
  });
}

// Then on specific components:
MyComponent.whyDidYouRender = true;
```
